Hi, I’m Edson Mito Kimwaka, an ICT Support Technician with a solid foundation in networking, hardware support, and fiber optic technologies. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from Kirinyaga University and am currently advancing my skills in Cloud and Network Security through the Cyber Shujaa program.

With hands-on experience at the Ministry of Education, Kenya Power (KPLC), and Mombasa Law Courts, I’ve supported mission-critical IT environments—handling everything from help desk support to fiber splicing and network device configuration.

I’m passionate about solving technical challenges, continuously learning, and making digital environments more efficient and secure. Whether in the classroom, server room, or field, I bring precision, adaptability, and a strong work ethic.

Let’s connect and build something impactful.
